      <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
      <p>
        The artifact selected for this enhancement is the Grazioso Salvare Animal Shelter Dashboard,
        originally developed during CS 340: Client/Server Development. The project consists of a
        MongoDB backend and a Python-based dashboard built with Dash and Plotly that allows users
        to filter, analyze, and visualize animal shelter records.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system supports identifying dogs suitable for specialized rescue training such as
        water rescue, disaster response, and wilderness search operations. The original version
        of the dashboard was functionally correct but relied heavily on client-side data processing
        and repetitive conditional logic for filtering and aggregation.

      <h3>Justification for Inclusion in the ePortfolio</h3>
      <p>
        This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates applied
        algorithmic reasoning in a realistic, data-driven application. The project requires
        efficient handling of structured datasets, careful selection of algorithms, and explicit
        trade-off analysis between competing design approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key components of the enhancement showcase my skills in algorithms and data structures,
        including centralized query mappings to reduce conditional complexity, database-side
        filtering to minimize unnecessary data transfer, and aggregation logic that groups and
        summarizes large datasets efficiently. The enhancement emphasizes scalability,
        maintainability, and correctness rather than surface-level functionality.
      </p>

      <h3>Alignment With Planned Course Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        This enhancement aligns with the course outcomes identified earlier in the term. In
        particular, it demonstrates the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions
        using algorithmic principles while managing trade-offs between client-side processing
        and database-side querying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project also illustrates the use of industry-relevant tools and techniques, including
        MongoDB aggregation pipelines, structured query design, and defensive validation when
        working with indexed datasets. No updates to the original outcome coverage plan are
        required, as the enhancement fulfills its intended scope.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
      <p>
        Enhancing this artifact reinforced the importance of placing algorithms at the appropriate
        layer of a system. While client-side processing was initially sufficient for small datasets,
        refactoring the logic to rely on database-side filtering and aggregation significantly
        improved efficiency and scalability.
      </p>
      <p>
        One challenge involved restructuring existing logic without breaking dashboard behavior.
        This required careful testing and validation, particularly when replacing fragile index-based
        access patterns with safer, column-based data access. The process emphasized defensive
        programming and the value of maintainable algorithm design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this enhancement strengthened my ability to reason about algorithmic efficiency
        in practical applications and to clearly communicate the rationale behind design decisions.

          Filtering and aggregation behavior can be verified by running the dashboard and observing
          database-side query execution and aggregation results.
