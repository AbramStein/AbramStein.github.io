      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Completing the Computer Science program and the CS 499 capstone has provided an opportunity to reflect on my academic
        journey, professional growth, and readiness to enter the field of software development. Throughout the program, I
        progressed from having no formal background in programming or computer architecture to developing the ability to
        analyze problems, design solutions, and improve existing systems using industry aligned tools and practices. The
        process of building this ePortfolio required me to revisit earlier work, evaluate it critically, and apply lessons
        learned across the curriculum, reinforcing both technical competence and professional confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        My path to computer science was not linear. I initially entered higher education with the goal of becoming a Lutheran
        pastor, but after realizing that path was not the right fit, I reassessed my interests and strengths. Discovering
        Southern New Hampshire University and enrolling in the Computer Science program allowed me to pursue a long standing
        interest in technology, creativity, and system design. I have always enjoyed imagining worlds, systems, and ideas,
        and software development emerged as a practical way to translate those concepts into tangible, functional projects.
        As I progressed through the program, my understanding of the field became more realistic and disciplined. I learned
        that software development requires persistence, structured problem solving, and continuous learning rather than
        inspiration alone. While I do not consider myself a master of the discipline, I have gained confidence in my ability
        to work through complex challenges and deliver reliable solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coursework across the program strengthened my ability to collaborate, communicate, and think systematically. In
        project based courses, I engaged in peer discussions, design reviews, and feedback cycles that emphasized clarity,
        accountability, and shared understanding. These experiences reinforced the importance of writing readable,
        maintainable code and documenting decisions in a way that supports collaboration in team environments. Communication
        was further developed through written narratives, technical documentation, and presentations that required adapting
        technical detail to different audiences, including instructors, peers, and hypothetical stakeholders. The CS 499 code
        review process in particular mirrored professional expectations by requiring clear explanation of existing
        functionality, identification of weaknesses, and justification of design improvements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The program also emphasized strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles.
        Courses such as CS 260 and CS 340 reinforced algorithmic thinking, trade off analysis, and efficiency considerations
        when working with structured data. I learned to select appropriate data structures, evaluate performance
        implications, and refactor logic to improve scalability and maintainability. Software engineering concepts such as
        separation of concerns, modular design, lifecycle awareness, and defensive programming were consistently reinforced
        through coursework and applied directly during the capstone enhancements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Database design and data persistence became a central area of growth as well. Through coursework and project work, I
        developed an understanding of schema design, CRUD operations, and the importance of validating and protecting stored
        data. These experiences highlighted how database decisions directly affect application reliability, security, and long
        term maintainability. Alongside this, the program fostered a security focused mindset. Courses addressing secure
        coding and system design emphasized anticipating misuse, validating inputs, protecting sensitive information, and
        minimizing attack surfaces. Security became an integrated consideration rather than an afterthought, influencing both
        architectural and implementation level decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The artifacts presented in this ePortfolio reflect this integrated skill set. Although the enhanced artifacts
        originate from CS 360 and CS 340, they collectively demonstrate growth across software design and engineering,
        algorithms and data structures, and databases. Together, they show my ability to analyze existing systems, identify
        weaknesses, apply feedback, and implement targeted improvements that increase reliability, efficiency, and security.
        The artifacts are intentionally connected, highlighting consistent problem solving approaches rather than isolated
        technical accomplishments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, the CS 499 capstone and the Computer Science program have helped shape my professional goals and values. I
        remain interested in game and application development, while recognizing the competitiveness of those fields and the
        importance of strong foundational skills. Rather than focusing on a single narrow role, I have prioritized developing
        transferable competencies that support adaptability and long term growth. This ePortfolio represents both my
        technical progress and my professional mindset, demonstrating readiness to contribute, learn, and grow within the
        computer science field.
