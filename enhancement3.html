      <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
      <p>
        The artifact selected for this enhancement is the CS 360 Scale Up! Weight Tracker App,
        originally developed during the CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course.
        The application is an Android-based mobile app that allows users to create accounts,
        authenticate securely, and store weight tracking data using a local SQLite database.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original implementation supported basic data persistence and CRUD operations but
        relied on minimal validation and stored sensitive data in an insecure format. While
        functionally correct, the database design and access patterns left opportunities for
        improvement in security, maintainability, and structural clarity.
      </p>

      <h3>Justification for Inclusion in the ePortfolio</h3>
      <p>
        This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates
        practical database design within a real-world application context. The system manages
        persistent user data, authentication records, and time-series weight entries, making
        it a strong example of applied database-backed software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The enhancement showcases my ability to identify weaknesses in an existing database
        design and implement improvements using industry-aligned practices. Key improvements
        include schema refinement, centralized data access, strict validation, and secure
        credential storage. Together, these changes significantly improve the reliability
        and security of the application.

      <h3>Implemented Database Enhancements</h3>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Refactored database schema with explicit foreign key relationships and constraints</li>
        <li>Centralized all CRUD operations using a repository pattern</li>
        <li>Added layered input validation prior to all database writes</li>
        <li>Improved separation between UI logic and database access logic</li>
        <li>Replaced plaintext password storage with salted and hashed credentials</li>
        <li>Introduced a dedicated account creation screen to enforce stronger password rules</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Alignment With Planned Course Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        This enhancement demonstrates strong alignment with the planned course outcomes.
        In particular, it illustrates the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions
        involving persistent data, implement reliable database-backed systems, and apply
        a security-focused mindset when handling sensitive information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The refactored database architecture and secure credential handling directly support
        outcomes related to software engineering, database design, and security awareness.
        No changes to the original outcome coverage plan were required.
      </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
      <p>
        Enhancing this artifact reinforced the importance of treating databases as a critical
        component of application security and reliability rather than as simple storage
        mechanisms. Implementing secure password handling and enforcing validation at multiple
        layers highlighted how small design decisions can significantly impact system integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
        One challenge involved refactoring database access without breaking existing
        application behavior. This required careful testing and a clear separation of
        responsibilities between the UI and data layers. The process emphasized defensive
        programming and long-term maintainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this enhancement strengthened my confidence in designing secure,
        database-driven applications and communicating technical improvements clearly
        in a professional context.
